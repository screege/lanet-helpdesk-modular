# LANET Agent Assets

This directory contains icons and other assets for the LANET Windows Agent.

## Icons

The agent uses different icons to represent various states:

- `lanet_icon.ico` - Main LANET logo icon
- `online.ico` - Green icon for online status
- `warning.ico` - Yellow icon for warning status  
- `offline.ico` - Red icon for offline status

## Icon Requirements

Icons should be in ICO format with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64) for best compatibility with Windows.

If icon files are not present, the agent will create simple colored circles as fallback icons.

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Online ICO converters
- GIMP with ICO plugin
- IconForge or similar tools
- Windows built-in tools

The icons should be simple and clearly distinguishable at small sizes (16x16 pixels).
